# Botphyte is no longer maintained.
As time goes on, I start to have more responsibilities in the real world, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to maintain this project.

I'm very grateful for the feedback that everyone has given me throughout this journey. Botphyte has helped me improve my JavaScript knowledge, and I'm very grateful for the time I spent learning it.

Thank you everyone for using Botphyte, and I hope y'all will join me in the next journey.
